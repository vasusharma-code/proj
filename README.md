As a software engineer with strong expertise in the MERN stack, machine learning (ML), and software development engineering (SDE), I am excited to expand my skill set into Django. While I am new to Django, I am confident in my ability to quickly adapt and master it, leveraging my background in full-stack development and problem-solving.

I am eager to contribute to the project by learning the Django framework or, if needed, help shape the companyâ€™s tech stack by integrating my existing knowledge of modern web development practices like React.js, Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB, and Python. With my technical foundation, I am ready to take on challenges and drive the success of any project I work on.
